Helios-Net Tasks & Notes, Jan 27, 2012
======================================
Portforward listener registration on request.
Implement stream forwarding.
Implement remote port forwarding.
Stable soak test for port forwarding  (vs. jsch ?)
PortForward Identity ?  (Port 0 is a bit weird)
PortForward Registry ( arbitrary lookups, e.g. SSHRMI )
Shared Port Forward Tests  (See SSHService shared tests)
Negative pub-key auth tests
SSHService listener:  onAuthenticated callback
Negative Connects (bad port, bad host, slow host ? ---> Connect Timeout ?)
Periodic host key exchange
Real host key verifier
====
====
Improved echo service  (native as well ?)
Error Reporting: No Service Available / Not Authorized for Service
====
====
JMX Items:
	- Lifecycle for MBeans, Idle Grey Zone, Timeout and unregister
	- MBean for other services  [ stream forwarding, remote forwarding, X11-blah-blah, SFTP, SCP, Shell ]

====
====
HostKey verification from host file or DB.
SSHService and sub service load init from XML/Properties/JSON etc.
Known hosts file maintenance
====
====
SSHServiceFactory
 * Connection / Portforward / User Sharing / Authorization requirements to share
 * Connect / Read timeouts
 * Socket buffer size overrides
 * Known hosts file
 * Host / Credentials Repository
