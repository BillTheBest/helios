		<ul>
			<li>Global phase trigger optimizations:
				<ol>
					<li>TracerManager tracks if phase triggers are applied anywhere.
					This will save trace processors from having to iterate traces in 
					cases where it would otherwise deal only with copying on collection
					into another.</li>
					<li>In cases where we need to iterate a collection only to check for phase triggers,
					that job should be handed off to a thread pool, but not until we know for sure
					that the phase is complete.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Implement local OpenMetricTypes as an endpoint.</li>
			<li>Need a good model for defining and registering end points.</li>
			<li>Ditch the metric flush JMX event. Apply as part of OpenTypeMetrics.</li>
			<li>JMXMetric modes:<ul>
				<li><b>One2One</b>: One MBean per metric. The ObjectName of the MBean has 1:1 cardinality with the metric FQN</li>
				<li><b>NameSpace</b>: The ObjectName and MBean represents the lowest (most specific) portion of the metric namespace. The metric name is an attribute of the MBean
				and the value of the attribute is the OpenTypeMetric CompositeType.</li>
				<li><b>NameSpaceTable</b>: Same as NameSpace except the metrics are represented as one attribute in a TabularType.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Hook in real time data viewer</li>
			<li>ThreadPools need to be given a chance to clean up instead of interrupting threads, so we need to add a max shutdown time.
			At the same time, in sensitive components like IA, a stop needs a little more TLC.</li>
